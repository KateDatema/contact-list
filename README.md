# My Contacts
## A mobile-first application for storing contact information and notes.

### What is this?
This is a web application designed to run on your phone.  With this app, you may add new contacts to a contact list, then call them from the application itself by selecting the name of the contact in the list.  [Try it for yourself](https://slothwerks-studio.github.io/contact-list/)!

### Why did you build this?
This public repository was built to teach the basic fundamentals of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application.

### How do I check out the code?

#### File download
The easiest method is to simply download the files to your computer.

- Click on the code download button on this repo and select Download ZIP.
- Save the ZIP package to the desktop of your computer.
- Once downloaded, [extract the files](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/) to your desktop.  This should create a new folder called `contact-list-main`, but you can rename it to whatever you like.

#### Forking the repository
*Coming soon!*

### How do I play with the code on my own computer?
Well, you'll want to install a nifty programming application such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Once installed, open the software.  Go to View > Extensions.
- In the extensions search bar, type "Live Server".  Select the Live Server extension by Ritwick Day in the results (it should be the top result).
- Click on the Install button.  Once installed, close VS Code and open it again.
- Go to File > Open Folder and select the folder on your desktop containing the project files.
- Once loaded, at the very bottom-right of the VS Code window you should see an option that says "Go Live".  Click on this; a new tab should appear in your browser with the application running.
- If you make changes to any of the project files, select File > Save.  The application should automatically reload within the browser, allowing you to access your changes immediately.

### This application seems kinda lame.
Well, that's because we haven't made many changes to it yet.  Let's work together to add new features and improve the app!
